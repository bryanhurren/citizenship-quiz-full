# Test Version Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented support for both the 2008 and 2025 US Citizenship Test versions in the quiz application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Questions Database
- **Created** `questions-2025.js` with all 128 official USCIS 2025 test questions
- Both question files are now loaded in the application

### 2. User Interface Updates

#### Mode Selection Screen
- Added test version selector before mode selection
- Displays context about N-400 filing dates:
  - **2008 Test**: File Form N-400 before Oct 20, 2025 → 100 questions, need 60/100 to pass
  - **2025 Test**: File Form N-400 on/after Oct 20, 2025 → 128 questions, need 77/128 to pass (60%)

#### Quiz Display
- Question counter now shows correct total based on test version (100 or 128)
- Stats row dynamically updates with correct totals
- Results screen shows score with test-specific pass threshold

#### Your Sessions Table
- Now displays date started (DD-MM-YYYY format)
- Shows test version (2008 or 2025) for each session
- Updated grid layout to accommodate new columns

### 3. Quiz Logic Updates
- Questions are loaded from appropriate file based on test version selection
- Pass/fail threshold is test-specific:
  - 2008: 60/100 correct needed
  - 2025: 77/128 correct needed (60%)
- All question navigation respects the correct total count
- Scoring and completion logic work for both test versions

### 4. Database Integration
- Application saves `test_version` field to user records
- Uses `last_session_date` for session start date
- Profile and session displays handle both test versions correctly

## Database Schema Update Required

⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: You need to add the `test_version` column to your Supabase database.

### Option 1: Using Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL script in `add_test_version_column.sql`

### Option 2: Manual Column Addition
1. Go to Table Editor → users table
2. Add new column:
   - Name: `test_version`
   - Type: `text`
   - Default value: `'2008'`
   - Nullable: Yes

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test the following:

- [ ] Create a new session and select 2008 test version
- [ ] Verify 100 questions are shown
- [ ] Complete a session and verify pass threshold is 60/100
- [ ] Create a new session and select 2025 test version
- [ ] Verify 128 questions are shown
- [ ] Complete a session and verify pass threshold is 77/128
- [ ] Check "Your Sessions" table shows correct date and test version
- [ ] Resume a session and verify it loads the correct test version
- [ ] Test both formal and comedy modes with both test versions

## Files Modified

1. `citizenship-quiz.html` - Main application file with all UI and logic updates
2. `questions-2025.js` - New file with 128 questions

## Files Created

1. `questions-2025.js` - 2025 test questions
2. `add_test_version_column.sql` - Database schema update script
3. `TEST_VERSION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Deployment

Once local testing is complete and database schema is updated:

1. Commit all changes to git
2. Push to your repository
3. Vercel will automatically deploy
4. Test the production deployment with both test versions

## Backwards Compatibility

- Existing user sessions without a test version will default to 2008
- Legacy sessions will continue to work correctly
- Best scores from old sessions are preserved

## Notes

- The app requires both test version AND mode selection before starting
- The start button is disabled until both selections are made
- Date format for sessions is DD-MM-YYYY (international format)
- Test version is displayed in the session list for clarity
