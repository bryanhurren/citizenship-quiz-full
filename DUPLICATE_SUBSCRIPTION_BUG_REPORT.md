# Duplicate Subscription Bug Report

**Date Discovered**: 2025-10-25
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Financial Impact
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED (as of 2025-10-25 16:56 UTC)

---

## Executive Summary

A critical bug was discovered where the system created **multiple Stripe subscriptions** for the same user, resulting in duplicate charges. The system did not check for existing active subscriptions before creating new checkout sessions.

### Impact
- **Users Affected**: Potentially all web users who attempted to re-subscribe
- **Financial Impact**: Multiple $0.99/week charges per affected user
- **Database Integrity**: Multiple Stripe customer records and subscriptions per user

---

## Root Cause

The `create-checkout-session.js` endpoint did **not check** if a user already had an active Stripe subscription before creating a new checkout session. This meant:

1. User purchases subscription ‚Üí Gets charged $0.99
2. Subscription fails to sync to database (due to missing billing periods bug)
3. User sees "Free" tier, tries to subscribe again
4. System creates NEW subscription instead of recognizing existing one
5. User gets charged AGAIN ($0.99 #2)
6. Repeat for each attempted "fix"

## Fix Applied

### 1. Prevention - Updated `create-checkout-session.js`

**File**: `CitizenshipQuizWeb/api/create-checkout-session.js`

**Change**: Added pre-checkout validation
```javascript
// Check if user already has an active subscription
const existingCustomers = await stripe.customers.list({
  email: userEmail,
  limit: 10,
});

// Check if any customer has an active subscription
for (const customer of existingCustomers.data) {
  const subscriptions = await stripe.subscriptions.list({
    customer: customer.id,
    status: 'active',
    limit: 10,
  });

  if (subscriptions.data.length > 0) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      error: 'You already have an active subscription',
      existingSubscriptionId: subscriptions.data[0].id,
      customerId: customer.id,
      message: 'Please contact support if you believe this is an error.',
    });
  }
}
```

**Result**: New checkout sessions are now blocked if user has active subscription.

---

### 2. Cleanup - Created `cancel-duplicate-subscriptions.js`

**File**: `CitizenshipQuizWeb/api/cancel-duplicate-subscriptions.js`

**Features**:
- Finds all subscriptions for a user email
- Keeps the oldest subscription (first created)
- Cancels newer duplicate subscriptions
- Supports `dryRun=true` for safe preview
- Updates database with correct subscription ID

**Usage**:
```bash
# Dry run (preview only)
curl "https://www.theeclodapps.com/api/cancel-duplicate-subscriptions?secret=temp-fix-2025&userEmail=user@example.com&dryRun=true"

# Live execution (cancels duplicates)
curl "https://www.theeclodapps.com/api/cancel-duplicate-subscriptions?secret=temp-fix-2025&userEmail=user@example.com&dryRun=false"
```

## Prevention Going Forward

‚úÖ Cleanup endpoint available for future issues
‚úÖ Database updates ensure consistency

### Still Needed
- [ ] Automated monitoring for duplicate subscriptions
- [ ] Daily reconciliation job
- [ ] Customer-facing subscription management UI
- [ ] Alert system for subscription anomalies

## Technical Details

### Why Multiple Subscriptions Were Created

The duplicate subscription bug occurred due to **two separate bugs working together**:

**Bug #1: Missing Billing Periods**
- Stripe subscriptions created without `current_period_start/end`
- Webhook couldn't set `subscription_expires_at` in database
- Users showed as "Free" despite paying

**Bug #2: No Duplicate Check** (THIS BUG)
- Checkout endpoint didn't verify existing subscriptions
- Users seeing "Free" would try to subscribe again
- System created new subscription instead of recognizing existing one

### Fix Interaction

Both bugs needed to be fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **Bug #1 Fix**: Added 7-day fallback for missing billing periods
2. ‚úÖ **Bug #2 Fix**: Added duplicate subscription prevention

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check for existing resources** before creating paid resources
2. **Implement comprehensive error handling** for payment flows
3. **Add monitoring early** - detect anomalies before they become expensive
4. **Test subscription edge cases** - expired, duplicate, failed payment, etc.
5. **Rate limiting is not enough** - need business logic validation too
