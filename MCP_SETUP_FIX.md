# MCP Setup Fix - Package Name Errors

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Issue**: Wrong package names caused 3 out of 5 MCP servers to fail

---

## What Went Wrong

I initially provided **incorrect package names** for 3 MCP servers. The packages didn't exist in npm, causing installation failures.

### Failed Packages (404 Not Found):
1. ❌ `@executeautomation/mcp-playwright` → Does NOT exist
2. ❌ `@stripe/mcp-server` → Does NOT exist
3. ❌ `@anthropic/mcp-multi-agent-coordinator` → Does NOT exist

### Working Packages:
1. ✅ `@upstash/context7-mcp` → Working (Context7)
2. ✅ `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` → Working (Memory)

---

## Fixed Configuration

**New corrected config file**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp"]
    },
    "stripe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@stripe/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": "sk_test_51SLEgsFW0vYph1LcJG9q4dH2f9wTnd4bMUpiNSIagEIqmDkjC3nkvBMJAaCMUVCJlc5AZ3KkUhqyZ4pDSnk07IVm00DX5P8GtE"
      }
    },
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Package Name Corrections

| MCP Server | ❌ Wrong Package | ✅ Correct Package |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Playwright | `@executeautomation/mcp-playwright` | `@playwright/mcp` |
| Stripe | `@stripe/mcp-server` | `@stripe/mcp` |
| Multi-Agent | `@anthropic/mcp-multi-agent-coordinator` | **REMOVED** (doesn't exist) |

---

## Why Multi-Agent Coordinator Was Removed

After research, I discovered that **`@anthropic/mcp-multi-agent-coordinator` does not exist** as a published npm package.

There are similar packages like:
- `@lastmile-ai/mcp-agent` - Multi-agent workflows
- `agentic-flow` - Multi-agent deployment

But none match the exact package name I originally provided. Since you wanted the official Anthropic version and it doesn't exist, I removed it from the config.

## Current MCP Server Status

After the fix, you should have **4 working MCP servers**:

1. ✅ **Context7** - Up-to-date documentation
2. ✅ **Playwright** - Browser automation (official Microsoft/Playwright version)
3. ✅ **Stripe** - Payment debugging and API queries
4. ✅ **Memory** - Persistent knowledge graph

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Claude Desktop
**IMPORTANT**: You must restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect:
- Quit Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q)
- Reopen Claude Desktop
- Check Settings → MCP Servers

### 2. Verify Installation
Once restarted, check the logs again:
```bash
cat ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log
```

You should now see:
- ✅ `[context7] Server started and connected successfully`
- ✅ `[playwright] Server started and connected successfully`
- ✅ `[stripe] Server started and connected successfully`
- ✅ `[memory] Server started and connected successfully`

### 3. Test Each MCP Server

In Claude Desktop (not Claude Code), try these commands:

**Test Context7:**
```
"Get the latest Expo SDK 54 Google Sign-In documentation"
```

**Test Playwright:**
```
"Open https://www.theeclodapps.com and take a screenshot"
```

**Test Stripe:**
```
"Look up all active subscriptions"
```

**Test Memory:**
```
"Remember that we always deploy from CitizenshipQuizWeb directory"
```

## If You Still Want Multi-Agent Coordination

Since the Anthropic package doesn't exist, your options are:

### Option 1: Use Manual Coordination (Recommended)
- Use separate git branches for different terminals
- Assign different directories to each terminal
- See strategies in the earlier conversation

### Option 2: Try Alternative Packages
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-agent": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lastmile-ai/mcp-agent"]
    }
  }
}
```

But this is not the official Anthropic version and may work differently.

## Apology & Lesson Learned

**My mistake**: I should have verified the package names existed in npm before creating the config.

**What I learned**: Always check if an npm package actually exists before recommending it, especially for newer tools like MCP servers.

**Your patience**: Thanks for catching this and providing the log files - that made debugging straightforward!
