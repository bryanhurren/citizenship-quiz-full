# Stripe Expiration Date Fix

## Problem Identified

You correctly identified that Stripe **IS** providing expiration dates in the webhook:
```json
"current_period_end": 1761865327
```

However, our webhook code wasn't using it properly!

## Root Cause

The webhook flow was:

1. **`checkout.session.completed`** fires first
   - Has user ID in metadata ‚úÖ
   - Tries to fetch subscription via API
   - **BUT** if API call fails (subscription not fully created yet), falls back to 7-day default ‚ùå

2. **`customer.subscription.created`** fires second
   - Has complete subscription data including `current_period_end` ‚úÖ
   - **BUT** we only logged it, didn't update the database ‚ùå

The data was there all along - we just weren't using it!

## The Fix

### What Changed:

1. **Store subscription ID** in `checkout.session.completed`
   - Added `stripe_subscription_id` to database update
   - This allows us to look up users in subsequent webhook events

2. **Use subscription data** in `customer.subscription.created`
   - Now actually updates user's expiration date from the webhook data
   - Looks up user by `stripe_subscription_id`

3. **Handle renewals** in `customer.subscription.updated`
   - Updates expiration when subscription renews

4. **Handle cancellations** in `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Downgrades user to free tier when they cancel

### Database Migration Required:

**Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Add stripe_subscription_id column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_subscription_id TEXT;

-- Create index for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_stripe_subscription_id ON users(stripe_subscription_id);
```

Or use the file: `add-stripe-subscription-id-column.sql`

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Run the migration from `add-stripe-subscription-id-column.sql`
3. Verify column exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'stripe_subscription_id';
   ```

### Step 2: Make Test Purchase
1. Go to https://www.theeclodapps.com
2. Sign in or create new account
3. Click "Upgrade" ‚Üí Complete Stripe checkout
4. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

### Step 3: Verify Webhook Logs
Check Vercel logs (https://vercel.com/bryan-hs-projects-3bca947e/claude-test/logs):

**Expected output:**
```
handleCheckoutSessionCompleted called
‚úÖ Subscription expires at: 2025-04-29T...
‚úÖ Updated expiration for user from subscription.created event
```

### Step 4: Check Admin Console
1. Go to admin console
2. Find your user
3. **Expiration date should now show:** `2025-04-29T...` (not NULL!)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ‚úÖ What Should Happen:

1. Purchase completes ‚Üí User gets 7-day default initially
2. `customer.subscription.created` fires ‚Üí Updates to real expiration (7 days from now)
3. Admin console shows actual expiration date
4. Subscription renews ‚Üí Expiration automatically extends
5. User cancels ‚Üí Immediately downgraded to free

### üîÑ Webhook Event Flow:

```
User clicks "Upgrade"
    ‚Üì
Stripe Checkout
    ‚Üì
checkout.session.completed ‚Üê Sets premium + 7-day default + stores subscription ID
    ‚Üì
customer.subscription.created ‚Üê Updates to REAL expiration from Stripe
    ‚Üì
User has correct expiration! ‚úÖ
```

## What About RevenueCat (iOS)?

For RevenueCat, we still need to diagnose why `expirationDate` isn't being returned. That requires:

1. Make test purchase on iOS
2. Check Xcode console for debug output
3. See what RevenueCat is actually returning

The 7-day fallback will protect users in the meantime.

## Summary

**Stripe Issue:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Webhook now properly uses `customer.subscription.created` data
**RevenueCat Issue:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Still investigating** - Need to see debug logs

**Action Required:**
1. Run database migration (add `stripe_subscription_id` column)
2. Test purchase on web
3. Verify expiration shows in admin console
4. Make iOS purchase and share debug logs

The web version should now work perfectly!
