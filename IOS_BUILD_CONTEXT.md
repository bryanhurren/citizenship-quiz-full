# iOS Build Issue Context - 2025-10-27

## What Was Fixed (Already Complete)
All quiz functionality bugs are fixed and deployed to web at https://www.theeclodapps.com:

1. ✅ **Focus mode completion bug** - Fixed in `CitizenshipQuizApp/src/screens/QuizScreen.tsx` and `CitizenshipQuizWeb/src/screens/QuizScreen.tsx`
   - Root cause: `checkSessionStatus()` was checking `totalQuestionsAsked >= totalQuestionsToAsk` (10 for 2008 test), but focused mode might only have 1-5 questions
   - Fix: Added focused mode-specific logic to check `totalQuestionsAsked >= shuffledQuestions.length`

2. ✅ **Navigation reset issues** - Fixed in `AppNavigator.tsx` (both app and web)
   - Added logic to reset Session stack to ModeSelection after completion screens

3. ✅ **AI evaluation parsing** - Fixed in `api/evaluate.js`
   - Added lowercase normalization for grade field (Claude was returning "Correct" instead of "correct")

4. ✅ **Past sessions formatting** - Fixed in `PastSessionsScreen.tsx`
   - Added `study_mode` field and conditional display logic for focused mode

5. ✅ **Study mode tracking** - Fixed in `quizStore.ts`
   - Added `study_mode` to session saves

## Current iOS Build Blocker

**Problem**: SwiftVerifyEmittedModuleInterface errors preventing all iOS builds

**Error**: Various Swift pods failing module verification:
- GTMAppAuth: "no such module 'AppAuth'"
- RevenueCat: "underlying Objective-C module 'RevenueCat' not found"

**What We Tried** (all failed with same error):
- Release configuration build
- Debug configuration build
- Updated dependencies (made it worse - reverted to working versions)
- Clean builds, pod reinstalls
- Deleted derived data multiple times
- `pod cache clean --all`
- Building via Xcode GUI and CLI
- Building via `npx expo run:ios`

**Current State**:
- Dependencies reverted to last working versions:
  - expo: 54.0.16
  - react-native: 0.81.4
  - react-native-purchases: 9.5.4
- Fresh pod install completed
- All quiz code fixes are in place and ready
- Xcode 16.2 installed (correct version - 16.3 has worse issues)

**Next Step**: Restart Mac to clear Xcode/macOS module caches

## After Restart

1. Open Terminal
2. `cd /Users/bryanhurren/Documents/claude-test/CitizenshipQuizApp/ios`
3. `open AICitizenQuiz.xcworkspace`
4. Select "Bryan's iPhone" as destination
5. Press Cmd+R to build and run
6. If it still fails, share the error and mention you read this file
